I code as a hobby and enjoy using programming to explore stem and computers, and there is no specific type of project that I make more often. My projects, including those that are not here on github, can also be found at <a href=https://sk1-z.github.io>https://sk1-z.github.io</a>

    <a href="https://github.com/Sk1-z/CompleteC" >CompleteC</a> is my attempt at a standard library for the C language. I wanted to make C feel more batteries included while still remaining true to the style of the language. It is not meant to make C easy, just remove the need to make the same types of structs and functions everytime a new project is started in a modular style.

    <a href="https://github.com/Sk1-z/Contra" >Contra</a> is a secure password manager I made for those looking for something quick, easy, and detached from the internet. I found that with password manager's I've tried in the past, that they would also try to do a lot more then what they were initially made to do, I wanted to break that pattern with Contra, it is a secure password manager and nothing else.
